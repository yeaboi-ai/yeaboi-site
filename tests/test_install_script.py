"""Tests for docs/install.sh — the `curl | sh` bootstrapper behind yeaboi.ai/install.sh.

The script exists because `pip` and `pipx` both install with the interpreter they
are run with, and hard-fail when it is too old — the single most common reason a
first-time user never reaches the product. `uv tool install` fetches its own
interpreter instead, so this script's whole job is to get uv onto the machine and
then hand it a version specifier.

Two properties are worth testing rather than trusting. The script is served
straight off `main` by GitHub Pages with no build step and no deploy job, so
nothing else in the pipeline would notice it breaking. And it is executed by
strangers over a pipe, which constrains it in ways a normal script is not
constrained: it must never read stdin (under `curl | sh` the script *is* stdin,
so one `read` would swallow the rest of itself), and it must be POSIX sh (the
documented invocation pipes into `sh`, which is dash on Debian and Ubuntu).

The behavioural tests follow tests/unit/test_wt_script.py: build a stub PATH in
tmp_path, run the real script, and inspect what it did.
